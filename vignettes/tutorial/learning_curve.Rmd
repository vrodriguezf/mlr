To analyze how the increase of observations in the training set improves the performance of a learner the *learning curve* is an appropriate visual tool.
The experiment is conducted with an increasing subsample size and the performance is measured.
In the plot the x-axis represents the relative subsample size whereas the y-axis represents the performance.

Note that this function internally uses `benchmark()` in combination with `makeDownsampleWrapper()`, so for every run new observations are drawn.
Thus the results are noisy.
To reduce noise increase the number of resampling iterations.
You can define the resampling method in the `resampling` argument of `generateLearningCurveData()`.
It is also possible to pass a ResampleInstance (`makeResampleInstance()`) (which is a result of `makeResampleInstance()`) to make resampling consistent for all passed learners and each step of increasing the number of observations.

## Plotting the learning curve

The `mlr` function `generateLearningCurveData()` can generate the data for *learning curves* for [multiple learners](integrated_learners.html){target="_blank"} and multiple [performance measures](measures.html){target="_blank"} at once.
With `plotLearningCurve()` the result of `generateLearningCurveData()` can be plotted using `ggplot2`.
`plotLearningCurve()` has an argument `facet` which can be either `"measure"` or `"learner"`. 
By default `facet = "measure"` and facetted subplots are created for each measure input to `generateLearningCurveData()`.
If `facet = "measure"` learners are mapped to color, and vice versa.

```{r LearningCurveTPFP, fig.asp = 7/9}
r = generateLearningCurveData(
  learners = c("classif.rpart", "classif.knn"),
  task = sonar.task,
  percs = seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.2),
  measures = list(tp, fp, tn, fn),
  resampling = makeResampleDesc(method = "CV", iters = 5),
  show.info = FALSE)
plotLearningCurve(r)
```

What happens in `generateLearningCurveData()` is the following:
Each learner will be internally wrapped in a `DownsampleWrapper` (`makeDownsampleWrapper()`).
To measure the performance at the first step of `percs`, say `0.1`, first the data will be split into a *training* and a *test set* according to the given *resampling strategy*.
Then a random sample containing 10% of the observations of the *training set* will be drawn and used to train the learner.
The performance will be measured on the *complete test set*.
These steps will be repeated as defined by the given *resampling method* and for each value of `percs`.

In the first example we simply passed a vector of learner names to `generateLearningCurveData()`.
As usual, you can also create the learners beforehand and provide a `list` of Learner (`makeLearner()`) objects, or even pass a mixed `list` of Learner (`makeLearner()`) objects and strings.
Make sure that all learners have unique `id`s.

```{r LearningCurveACCx, fig.asp = 3/4}
lrns = list(
  makeLearner(cl = "classif.ksvm", id = "ksvm1", sigma = 0.2, C = 2),
  makeLearner(cl = "classif.ksvm", id = "ksvm2", sigma = 0.1, C = 1),
  "classif.randomForest"
)
rin = makeResampleDesc(method = "CV", iters = 5)
lc = generateLearningCurveData(learners = lrns, task = sonar.task,
  percs = seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1), measures = acc,
  resampling = rin, show.info = FALSE)
plotLearningCurve(lc)
```

We can display performance on the train set as well as the test set:

```{r, fig.asp = 2/3}
rin2 = makeResampleDesc(method = "CV", iters = 5, predict = "both")
lc2 = generateLearningCurveData(learners = lrns, task = sonar.task,
  percs = seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1),
  measures = list(acc, setAggregation(acc, train.mean)), resampling = rin2,
  show.info = FALSE)
plotLearningCurve(lc2, facet = "learner")
```

There is also an experimental `ggvis` plotting function, `plotLearningCurveGGVIS()`. 
Instead of the `facet` argument to `plotLearningCurve()` there is an argument `interaction` which plays a similar role. 
As subplots are not available in `ggvis`, measures or learners are mapped to an interactive sidebar which allows selection of the displayed measures or learners. 
The other feature is mapped to color.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotLearningCurveGGVIS(lc2, interaction = "measure")
plotLearningCurveGGVIS(lc2, interaction = "learner")
```
