We are always happy to receive pull requests.

Please make sure you have read our coding guidelines: 
https://www.notion.so/mlrorg/Style-Guide-740bc663207a4bbb9a457987bda6fd91

This especially means that you have understood:

* The style guide - our lintr will provide you feedback on this
* How to run tests locally. Yes, travis will also run them for you, bad it is annoying to wait for this.
* How to run R CMD CHECK locally. See point before. 

Also it's helpful to get into direct contact with the suggested reviewers to get help, getting your PR merged.
