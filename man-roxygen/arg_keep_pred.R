#' @param keep.pred (`logical(1)`)\cr
#'   Keep the prediction data in the `pred` slot of the result object.
#'   If you do many experiments (on larger data sets) these objects might unnecessarily increase
#'   object size / mem usage, if you do not really need them.
#'   The default is set to `TRUE`.
