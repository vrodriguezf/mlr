\title{Remove constant features from a data set.}
\usage{
removeConstantFeatures(obj, perc = 0, dont.rm = character(0L),
  na.ignore = FALSE, tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.5,
  show.info = getMlrOption("show.info"))
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{(\link{data.frame} | \link{Task})\cr
Input data.}

\item{perc}{(\code{numeric(1)})\cr
The percentage of a feature values in [0, 1) that must differ from the mode value.
Default is 0, which means only constant features with exactly one observed level are removed.}

\item{dont.rm}{(\link{character})\cr
Names of the columns which must not be deleted.
Default is no columns.}

\item{na.ignore}{(\code{logical(1)})\cr
Should NAs be ignored in the percentage calculation?
(Or should they be treated as a single, extra level in the percentage calculation?)
Note that if the feature has only missing values, it is always removed.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{tol}{(\code{numeric(1)})\cr
Numerical tolerance to treat two numbers as equal.
Variables stored as \code{double} will get rounded accordingly before computing the mode.
Default is \code{sqrt(.Maschine$double.eps)}.}

\item{show.info}{(\code{logical(1)})\cr
Print verbose output on console?
Default is set via \link{configureMlr}.}
}
\value{
\link{data.frame} | \link{Task}. Same type as \code{obj}.

\description{
Constant features can lead to errors in some models and obviously provide
no information in the training set that can be learned from.
With the argument \dQuote{perc}, there is a possibility to also remove
features for which less than \dQuote{perc} percent of the observations
differ from the mode value.
