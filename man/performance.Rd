\title{Measure performance of prediction.}
\usage{
performance(pred, measures, task = NULL, model = NULL, feats = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred}{(\link{Prediction})\cr
Prediction object.}

\item{measures}{(\link{Measure} | list of \link{Measure})\cr
Performance measure(s) to evaluate.
Default is the default measure for the task, see here \link{getDefaultMeasure}.}

\item{task}{(\link{Task})\cr
Learning task, might be requested by performance measure, usually not needed except for clustering or survival.}

\item{model}{(\link{WrappedModel})\cr
Model built on training data, might be requested by performance measure, usually not needed except for survival.}

\item{feats}{(\link{data.frame})\cr
Features of predicted data, usually not needed except for clustering.
If the prediction was generated from a \code{task}, you can also pass this instead and the features
are extracted from it.}
}
\value{
(named \link{numeric}). Performance value(s), named by measure(s).
}
\description{
Measures the quality of a prediction w.r.t. some performance measure.
}
\examples{
training.set = seq(1, nrow(iris), by = 2)
test.set = seq(2, nrow(iris), by = 2)

task = makeClassifTask(data = iris, target = "Species")
lrn = makeLearner("classif.lda")
mod = train(lrn, task, subset = training.set)
pred = predict(mod, newdata = iris[test.set, ])
performance(pred, measures = mmce)

# Compute multiple performance measures at once
ms = list("mmce" = mmce, "acc" = acc, "timetrain" = timetrain)
performance(pred, measures = ms, task, mod)
